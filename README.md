# substitution_cipher

A practice in implementing Substitution Ciphers in Python & Ruby

This program is an implementation of the following ciphers:

* Monoalphabetic Shift Cipher
* Polyalphabetic Shift Cipher AKA Vigenere Cipher
* Monoalphabetic Affine Shift Cipher
* Polyalphabetic Affine Shift Cipher
* Playfair Cipher (forthcoming)
* Railfence Cipher (forthcoming)

## Requirements

Requires Python 3.x to run the Python implementations, Ruby 2.x to run the Ruby implementations.

## To Use

Clone this repoistory to your machine.  
Navigate to the cloned location on your system.
Choose the `python` directory for the Python implementation, or the `ruby` directory for the Ruby implemtnation.
Examine the cipher.* file in your language's directory to see what each function does.

See examples in the testing.* file for your language.

Add your own calculation and run as follows:

### Python:
```
$ python3 testing.py
```

### Ruby:
```
$ ruby testing.rb
```
